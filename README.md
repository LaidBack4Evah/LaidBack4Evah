- 👋 Hi, I’m @LaidBack4Evah
- 👀 I’m interested in Reverse Engineering, Dynamic Analysis, Evolving Threat Vectors and TTP's, and learning more code/scripting to implement to help drive analysis. In my free time, I like to take part in ultra "gran fondos"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how cloud and hybrid environments remain at risk, staying on task with daily reads and joining a team of more experienced analysts and engineers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on advanced code obfuscation, better understanding of programming concepts used in MA, et al.
- 📫 How to reach me? richardfrazierstewart@gmail.com
